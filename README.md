# URL Shortener

### About

This is a project taken from [RealPython.com](https://www.realpython.com/). Uses [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), and [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/) to build a little URL shortener. I'll be modifying the project to add new features.

### To Do:

- ~~build project~~
- URL blacklist
- access keys
- custom URL redirects
- web interface
- come up with a cool name :^(
